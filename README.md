# AVLTree
###### Java implementation of self-balancing AVL tree



AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. This project implements a AVL Tree. The data is given in the form (key) with no duplicates, This implemetation supports following operations:

1. Initialize (): create a new AVL tree
2. Insert (key)
3. Delete (key)
4. Search (key): returns the key if present in the tree else NULL
5. Search (key1, key2): returns keys that are in the range key1 ≤key ≤key2


AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. In this project, I have developed and tested an AVL Tree. Since the AVL tree is an extension of standard BST The code is structured to maximize inheritance from the standard Binary Search Tree. 




 This project is structured into three files and five classes as above :

AVLNode.java: contains the node structures.
Node: This is an abstract node to represent trees. 
AVLNode: This is the concrete representation of Node used in the implementation of AVL Tree.
AVLBST.java -: contains the AVL tree data structure.
BinarySearchTree: Standard binary search tree with insert, delete and search.
AVLBST: Concrete AVL tree implementation using BinarySearchTree as a superclass. In simple words, this class does the rebalancing using AVL properties on top of standard BST operations.
avltree: main program function with file operations
Makefile : to make the java classes.


#### To Compile and Run

`./makefile` or `javac greed.datastruct.Main.java`

and

`java avltree input_file_name`

 
The rest of the section presents the function prototypes.


# Documentation

#### `public class Main`

This program, contains a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL Tree</a>. Main class is the entrypoint of the program, it handle input output file operations and decoding of the input file.

#### `public static void main(String[] args)`

This is the main method of the program.

 * **Parameters:** `args` — takes one command line argument for input file, defaults to "input.txt" if not specified.

     This method call decodeAndRunCommands() to decode the input file line by line run respective commands on AVL tree.

     The final output is written to "output_file.txt".

#### `public static AVLTree decodeAndRunCommands(String command, AVLTree avlBinaryTree, BufferedWriter writer) throws IOException`

Takes one command and run the respective operation on AVL tree. Supported commands are Initialize, Insert, Delete and Search.

 * **Parameters:**
   * `command` — Command to run as a string ( eg -: Initialize(), Insert (60), Delete(23), Search(23), Search(2,10)).
   * `avlBinaryTree` — The AVL tree before the operation (defaults to null at the start).
   * `writer` — BufferedWriter representing the output file.
 * **Returns:** Returns the AVL tree after the operation.
 * **Exceptions:** `IOException` — Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred regarding output file (eg -: output file is not writable)

#### `public static void testAVLTree()`

This method contains test cases to evaluate the implementation. Not called by the main program by default.

#### `public class AVLTree extends BinarySearchTree<AVLNode>`

#### `@Override public Stack<AVLNode> delete(int key)`
