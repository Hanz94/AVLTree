# AVLTree
Java implementation of self-balancing AVL trees



AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. This project implements a AVL Tree. The data is given in the form (key) with no duplicates, This implemetation supports following operations:

1. Initialize (): create a new AVL tree
2. Insert (key)
3. Delete (key)
4. Search (key): returns the key if present in the tree else NULL
5. Search (key1, key2): returns keys that are in the range key1 ≤key ≤key2
